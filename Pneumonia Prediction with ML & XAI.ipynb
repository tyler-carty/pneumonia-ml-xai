    "# Pneumonia Prediction Using Chest X-Ray Images\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Pneumonia remains a significant public health challenge across the globe, contributing to considerable morbidity and mortality rates, particularly among the young, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and management of the disease. In recent years, the advent of machine learning and deep learning techniques has revolutionised the field of medical imaging, offering new avenues for enhancing diagnostic processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to harness the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a class of deep neural networks highly effective in analysing visual imagery, to develop a predictive model for pneumonia based on chest X-ray images. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, comprises numerous X-ray images categorised into 'NORMAL' and 'PNEUMONIA', providing a basis for training and evaluating our predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond mere prediction, this endeavour seeks to integrate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to shed light on the model's decision-making processes. The objective is not only to achieve high accuracy in pneumonia detection but also to enhance the interpretability and transparency of the predictions, thereby fostering trust and understanding among healthcare professionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In navigating through this project, we will embark on a comprehensive journey encompassing data preparation, model selection and evaluation, and the incorporation of XAI for insightful interpretations. Our ultimate goal is to contribute to the broader efforts in combating pneumonia through the innovative application of AI in medical diagnostics."
